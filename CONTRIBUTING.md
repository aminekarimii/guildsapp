## How to submit new changes

- Create a feature branch that matches a backlog item. You can create only one branch per backlog item
- Develop what is specified in said backlog item
- Unit test are life :)
- Before submiting a Merge request, you need to upgrade the minor version for the versionName by one increment, the same goes for the versionCode
- When done, submit a Merge request (targeting `develop` branch) with all the maintainers (please refer to the [README.md](https://gitlab.rabat.sqli.com/MobileFactory/GuildApp/guild-app/blob/develop/README.md)
- Finally when the Merge request has been approved by at least 2 maintainers, the branch can be merged to `develop`
- BONUS : Don't forget to submit your contribution to the guild staff to earn the points :)
